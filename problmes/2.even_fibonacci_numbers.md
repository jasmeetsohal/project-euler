Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#### 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solutions:

```Python```

```python
def fiboEvenSum(n):
  prev,next,sum = 1,2,2
  for i in range(2,n):
    if (prev+next)%2 == 0:
      sum = sum+(prev+next)
    prev,next = next,prev+next
  
  return sum

fiboEvenSum(10)
 ```

```JavaScript```

```javascript
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
   let [pre,next,sum]=[1,2,2];
   for(let i=2;i<n;i++){
     if( (pre+next)%2 === 0)
        sum += pre+next;

     [pre,next]= [next,pre+next];
   }
   return sum;
}

fiboEvenSum(10);
```
