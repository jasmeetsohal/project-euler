The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

#### 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

#### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Solutions:

```Python```

```python
def sum_square_difference(n):
  sum_squares,sum_naturals=0,0
  for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum_squares = sum_squares + i**2
    sum_naturals = sum_naturals + i
  
  return sum_naturals**2 - sum_squares 

sum_square_difference(100);
 ```

```JavaScript```

```javascript
function sumSquareDifference(n) {
  let [sum_squares,sum_naturals]=[0,0];
  for(let i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++){
    sum_squares = sum_squares + i*i;
    sum_naturals = sum_naturals + i;
  }
  return sum_naturals*sum_naturals - sum_squares;
}

sumSquareDifference(100);
```
